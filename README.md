# food-ordering-app
Food ordering application built in React, shows you the latest restaurants of your city.
This repository, "Namaste-React," serves as a comprehensive collection of notes and learnings from the #Namaste-React Course, with a specific project called "Food-Studio" developed alongside the course to apply the concepts learned.

**Food-Studio Project Overview:**
"Food-Studio" is a platform designed to enable users to conveniently order food from the comfort of their homes. It provides users with the latest information about available restaurants in their city, allowing them to browse through restaurant details, select dishes, add them to their cart, and place orders for delivery.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend Library: React JS
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Database: Firebase
- Bundler: Parcel
- Authentication: Firebase-Auth
- State Management: Redux Toolkit

**Project Functionality:**
- Fetches live restaurant data from the Swiggy API, displaying them with area name, cuisine category, and ratings.
- Enables users to search for restaurants by name and explore the various dishes available, including details and prices per quantity.
- Allows users to add items to their cart, authenticate themselves, and place orders.

**Improvements Needed:**
1. Responsiveness for mobile devices.
2. Implementing local storage for cart data to prevent loss on page refresh for non-logged-in users.
3. Addressing issues with user name display in the profile upon signup without needing a refresh.
4. Enhancing the design and incorporating user address and payment details.
5. Adding a feature to search for different cities, currently limited to Prayagraj.

**How to Run Locally:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm init`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Ensure you have a CORS extension installed in your browser.
